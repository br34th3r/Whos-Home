# Who's Home?

A small express app written in node to be run on our home Raspberry Pi, it allows my roommate and I to see who is home when, and to check in and out of the apartment.

Uses pug view engine in express to create the web UI and then node on the backend to handle all requests to the server!

To clone and use, simply run:

`git clone https://github.com/br34th3r/Whos-Home.git`
`cd Whos-Home`
`npm install`
`node whos-home.js`
